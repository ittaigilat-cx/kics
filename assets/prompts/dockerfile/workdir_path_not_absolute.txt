Explain the following Dockerfile code (taken from file ${file}) and check if there are any security issues 
related to "WORKDIR path not absolute" (this is the QUERY_NAME). This issue is about having a relative WORKDIR 
path instead of an absolute path. Having a relative WORKDIR path can lead to unexpected behavior and potential 
security issues, and for clarity and reliability, you should always use absolute paths for your WORKDIR. If 
WORDKIR is not specified, explain the default behavior.
If there are any security issues of this type, specify in what lines of the code they appear and explain the 
issues that were found and then write them as a REGO result file, one result for each issue found.
