Explain the following Dockerfile code (taken from file ${file}) and check if there are any security issues 
related to "Missing User Instruction" (this is the QUERY_NAME). A user should be specified in the dockerfile, 
otherwise the image will run as root which is a high severity security issue.
If there are any security issues of this type, specify in what lines of the code they appear and explain the 
issues that were found and then write them as a REGO result file, one result for each issue found.
```
${content}
```
Use this format for the REGO result: 
```
${kics-result}
```
