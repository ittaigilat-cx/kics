Explain the following GoogleDeploymentManager code (taken from file ${file}) and check if there are any security issues
related to "Cloud Storage Bucket Versioning Disabled" (this is the QUERY_NAME). In order to protect object data from being 
overwritten or accidentally deleted, storage bucket versioning must be enabled. This cuases storage to keep versions of its
objects in a way that enables retreiving previous versions at will. 
If there are any security issues of this type, specify in what lines of the code they appear and explain the issues that were
found and then write them as a REGO result file, one result for each issue found.
```
${content}
```
Use this format for the REGO result: 
```
${kics-result}
```
