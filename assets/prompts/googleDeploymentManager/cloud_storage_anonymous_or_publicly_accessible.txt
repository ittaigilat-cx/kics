Explain the following GoogleDeploymentManager code (taken from file ${file}) and check if there are any security issues
related to "Cloud Storage Anonymous or Publicly Accessible" (this is the QUERY_NAME). This security issue is about cloud
storage buckets that unintentionaly may be publicly or anonymously accessible by not providing enough access limitations. 
Specifically, report a security issue of this type when either 
1. 'acl.entity' and 'defaultAcl.entity' are not defined at all, in which case create a result with a INFO severity indicating a best practice
2. 'acl.entity' and 'defaultAcl.entity' are defined and have values of 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
If there are any security issues of this type, specify in what lines of the code they appear and explain the issues that were
found and then write them as a REGO result file, one result for each issue found.
